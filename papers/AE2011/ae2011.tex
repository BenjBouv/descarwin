\begin{abstract}
Learn-and-Optimize ~(LaO) ~is ~a ~generic ~surrogate ~based method for parameter tuning combining learning and optimization. In this paper LaO is used to tune Divide-and-Evolve (DaE), an Evolutionary Algorithm for AI Planning. The LaO framework makes it possible to learn the relation between some features describing a given instance and the optimal parameters for this instance, thus it enables to extrapolate this relation to unknown instances in the same domain. Moreover, the learned model is used as a surrogate-model to accelerate the search for the optimal parameters. The proposed implementation of LaO uses an Artificial Neural Network for learning the mapping between features and optimal parameters, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy for optimization. Results demonstrate that LaO is capable of improving the quality of the DaE results even with only a few iterations. The main limitation of the DaE case-study is the limited amount of meaningful features that are available to describe the instances. However, the learned model reaches almost the same performance on the test instances, which means that it is capable of generalization.

\section{Introduction}

Parameter tuning is basically a general optimization problem applied off-line to find the best parameters for complex algorithms, for example for Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). Whereas the efficiency of EAs has been demonstrated on several application domains \cite{practice08,ParameterSettingBook07}, they usually need computationally expensive parameter tuning. Being a general optimization problem, there are as many parameter tuning algorithms as optimization techniques. However, several specialized methods have been proposed, and the most prominent today are Racing \cite{birattari2002}, REVAC \cite{Nannen07}, SPO \cite{SPO:CEC05}, and ParamILS \cite{ParamILS-JAIR}. All these approaches face the same crucial generalization issue: can a parameter set that has been optimized for a given problem be successfully used to another one? The answer of course depends on the similarity of both problems.

However, in AI Planning, sufficiently accurate features have not been specified that would allow to describe the problem, no design of a general learning framework has been proposed, and no general experiments have been carried out. This paper makes a step toward a framework for parameter tuning applied generally for AI Planning and proposes a preliminary set of features. The Learn-and-Optimize (LaO) framework consists of the combination of optimizing and learning, i.e., finding the mapping between features and best parameters. Furthermore, the results of learning will already be useful during further the optimization phases, using the learned model as in standard surrogate-model based techniques (see e.g., \cite{Bardenet} for a Gaussian-process-based approach).

In this paper, the target optimization technique is Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), more precisely the evolutionary AI planner called Divide-and-Evolve (DaE). However, DaE will be here considered as a black-box algorithm, without any modification for the purpose of this work than its original version described in \cite{BibEvoCop:2010}. 

The paper is organized as follows: AI Planning Problems and the Divide-and-Evolve algorithm are briefly introduced in section \ref{section:planning}. Section \ref{section:LaO} introduces the original, top level parameter tuning method, Learn-and-Optimize. The case study presented in Section \ref{section:results} applies LaO to DaE, following the rules of the International Planning Competition 2011 -- Learning Track. Finally, conclusions are drawn and further directions of research are proposed in Section \ref{section:conclusions}. 

\section{AI Planning and Divide-and-Evolve}
\label{section:planning}

An Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning problem is defined by the triplet of an initial state, a goal state, and a set of possible actions. An action modifies the current state and can only be applied if certain conditions are met. A solution plan to a planning problem is an ordered list of actions, whose execution from the initial state achieves the goal state. 

Domain-independent planners rely on the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL2.1 \cite{Fox-JAIR-2003}. The domain file specifies object types and predicates, which define possible states, and actions, which define possible state changes. The instance scenario declares the actual objects of interest, sets the initial state and provides a description of the goal. A solution plan to a planning problem is a consistent schedule of grounded actions whose execution in the initial state leads to a state that contains the goal state, i.e., where all atoms of the problem goal are true. A planning problem defined on domain $D$ with initial state $I$ and goal $G$ will be denoted in the following as ${\cal P}_D(I,G)$.

Early approaches to AI Planning using Evolutionary Algorithms directly handled possible solutions, i.e. possible plans: an individual is an ordered sequence of actions see \cite{Spector-AAAI-94,muslea97,westerberg:2000,westerberg:2001,Morignot-2005}. However, as it is often the case in Evolutionary Combinatorial optimization, those direct encoding approaches have limited performance in comparison to the traditional AI planning approaches. Furthermore, hybridization with classical methods has been the way to success in many combinatorial domains, as witnessed by the fruitful emerging domain of memetic algorithms \cite{MemeticBook:2005}. Along those lines, though relying on an original ``memetization'' principle, a novel hybridization of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) with AI Planning, termed Divide-and-Evolve (DaE) has been proposed \cite{DAE:EvoCOP06,DAE:book-2007}. For a complete formal description, see \cite{Bibai:ICAPS2010}.

The basic idea of DaE in order to solve a planning task ${\cal P}_D(I,G)$ is to find a sequence of states $S_1, \ldots, S_n$, and to use some embedded planner to solve the series of planning problems ${\cal P}_D(S_{k},S_{k+1})$, for $k \in [0,n]$ (with the convention that $S_0 = I$ and $S_{n+1} = G$). The generation and optimization of the sequence of states $(S_i)_{i \in [1,n]}$ is driven by an evolutionary algorithm. 
The fitness (quality criterion) of a list of partial states $S_1, \ldots,$ $S_n$ is computed by repeatedly calling the external 'embedded' planner to solve the sequence of problems ${\cal P}_D(S_{k},S_{k+1})$, $\{k=0,\ldots,n\}$. The concatenation of the corresponding plans (possibly with some compression step) is a solution of the initial problem. Any existing planner can be used as embedded planner, but since guaranty of optimality at all calls is not mandatory in order for DaE to obtain good quality results \cite{Bibai:ICAPS2010}, a sub-optimal, but fast planner is used: YAHSP \cite{V:icaps04} is a lookahead strategy planning system for sub-optimal planning which uses the  actions in the relaxed plan to compute reachable states in order to speed up the search process. 

One-point crossover is used, adapted to variable-length representation in that both crossover points are independently chosen, uniformly in both parents.
Four different mutation operators have been designed, and once an individual has been chosen for mutation (according to a population-level mutation rate), the choice of which mutation to apply is made according to user-defined relative weights. Because an individual is a variable length list of states, and a state is a variable length list of atoms, the mutation operator can act at both levels: at the individual level by adding (addState) or removing (delState) 
a state; or at the state level by adding (addAtom) or removing (delAtom) some atoms in the given state. 


\section{Learn-and-Optimize for Parameter Tuning}
\label{section:LaO}

\subsection{The General LaO Framework}

As already mentioned, parameter tuning is actually a general global optimization problem, thus facing the routine issue of local optimality. But a further problem arises in parameter tuning, and this is the generality of the tuned parameters. Generalizing parameters learned on one instance to another instance of the same domain might be problematic, as there are instances with very different complexity in the same domain. For example in \cite{BibGECCO:2010} per-domain tuning was performed with the most difficult, largest instance, considered as a representative of the whole domain. However, it is clear from the results that these parameters were often suboptimal for the other instances. One workaround this generalization issue is to relax the constraint of finding a single universally optimal parameter-set, that certainly does not exist, and to focus on learning a complex relation between instances and optimal parameters. The proposed Learn-and-Optimize framework (LaO) aims at learning such relation by adding learning to optimization. The underlying hypothesis is that there exists a relation between some features describing an instance and the optimal parameters for solving this instance, and the goal of this work is to propose a general methodology to do so. 

Suppose for now that we have $n$ features and $m$ parameters, and we are doing per-instance parameter tuning on instance $\cal I$. For the sake of simplicity and generality, both the fitness, the features and the parameters are considered as real values. Parameter tuning is the optimization (e.g., minimization) of the fitness function \begin{math}f_{\cal I}:\mathbf{R}^m\to \mathbf{R} \end{math}, the expected value of the stochastic algorithm DaE executed with parameter \begin{math} p \in \mathbf{R}^m \end{math}. The optimal parameter set is defined by \begin{math} p_{opt}=argmin_p\{f_{\cal I}(p)\} \end{math}. For each instance $\cal I$, consider the set \begin{math} F({\cal I}) \in \mathbf{R}^n \end{math} of the features describing this instance. 
Two relations have to be taken into account: each planning instance has features, and it has an optimal parameter-set. In order to be able to generalize, we have to get rid of the instance, and collapse both relations into one single relation between feature-space and parameter-space. For the sake of simplicity let us assume that there exists an unambiguous mapping from the feature space to the optimal parameter space. 

\begin{equation} p_F: \mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{R}^m, p_F(F)=p_{opt} \end{equation}.	

The relation \begin{math} p_F \end{math} between features and optimal parameters can be learned by any supervised learning method capable of representing, interpolating and extrapolating  \begin{math}\mathbf{R}^n\to \mathbf{R}^m \end{math} mappings, provided sufficient data are available.

The idea of using some surrogate model in optimization is not new. Here, however, there are  several instances to optimize, and only one model is available, that maps the feature-space into the parameter-space. Nevertheless, there is no question about how to use such a model of \begin{math}p_F\end{math} in optimization: one can always ask the model for hints about a given parameter-set. It seems reasonable that the stopping criterion of LaO is determined by the stopping criterion of the optimizer algorithm. After exiting one can also do a re-training of the learner with the best parameters found.

\subsection{An Implementation of LaO}

A simple multilayer Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained with standard backpropagation was chosen here for the learning of the features-to-parameters mapping, though any other supervised-learning algorithm could have been used. The implicit hypothesis is that the relation \begin{math}p_F\end{math} is not very complex, which means that a simple ANN may be used. In this work, one mapping is trained for each domain. Training a single domain-independent ANN is left for future work. The other decision for LaO implementation is the choice of the optimizer used for parameter tuning. Because parameter optimization will be done successively for several instances, the simple yet robust (1+1)-Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy \cite{hansen2001ecj}, in short (1+1)-CMA-ES,  was chosen, and used with its robust own default parameters, as advocated in \cite{BibGECCO:2010}.

One original component, though, was added to some direct approach to parameter tuning: gene-transfer between instances. There will be one (1+1)-CMA-ES running for each instance, because using larger population sizes for a single instance would be far too costly. However, the (1+1)-CMA-ES algorithms running on all training instances form a population of individuals. The idea of Gene-Transfer is to use some crossover between the individuals of this population. Of course, the optimal parameter sets for the different instances are different; However, good 'chromosomes' for one instance may at least help another instance. Thus it may be used as a hint in the optimization of that other instance. Therefore random gene-transfer was used in the present implementation of LoA, by calling the so-called {\em Genetransferer}. When the Genetransferer is requested for a hint for one instance, it returns with uniform random distribution the so-far best parameter of a different instance (preventing, of course, that the default parameters are tried twice). Another benefit from gene-transfer is that it may smoothen out the ambiguities between instances, by increasing the probability for instances with the same features to test the same parameters, and thus the possibility to find out that the same parameters are appropriate for the same features. Figure \ref{figure:laoflowchart} shows the LAO framework with the described implementations.

\end{table*} 


One additional technical difficulty arose with CMA-ES: each parameter is here restricted to an interval. This seems reasonable and makes the global algorithm more stable. Hence the parameters of the optimizer are actually normalized linearly onto the [0,1] interval. It is hence possible to apply a simple version of the box constraint handling technique described in \cite{hansen2009tec}, with a penalty term simply defined by \begin{math}||p^{feas}-p|| \end{math}, where \begin{math}p^{feas}\end{math} is the closest value in the box. Moreover, only \begin{math}p^{feas}\end{math} was recorded as a feasible solution , and later passed to the ANN. Note that the GeneTransferer and the ANN itself cannot send hints outside of the box. In order to not to compromise too much CMA-ES, several iterations of this were carried out for one hint of the ANN and one gene-transfer.

The implementation of LaO algorithm uses the Shark library \cite{shark08} for CMA-ES and the FANN library for ANN \cite{nissen}. To evaluate each parameter-setting with each instance,  a cluster was used, that has approximately 60 nodes, most of them with 4 cores, some with 8. Because of the heterogeneity of the hardware architecture used here, it is not possible to rely on accurate predicted running times. Therefore, for each evaluation, the number of YAHSP evaluations is fixed for DaE. Moreover, since DaE is not deterministic, 11 independent runs were carried out for each DaE experiment with a given parameter-set, and the fitness of this parameter set was taken to be the median fitness-value obtained by DaE.

\section{Results}
\label{section:results}

In the Planning and Learning Part of IPC2011 (IPC), 5 sample domains were pre-published, with a corresponding problem-generator for each domain: Ferry, Freecell, Grid, Mprime, and Sokoban. Ferry and Sokoban were excluded from this study since there were not enough number of instances to learn any mapping. For each of the remaining 3 domains, 100 instances were generated, since this seemed to be appropriate for a running time of approximately 2-3 weeks: The competition track description fixes running time as 15 minutes. For each instance, 11 independent trials were run on a dedicated server to measure the median of number of evaluations with the default parameters. The termination criterion was the number of YAHSP evaluations. The median of those 11 runs was used as a termination criterion for each instance in the train set on any computer. However, many instances were never solved within 15 minutes, and those instances were dropped from the rest of experiment. The remaining instances were used for training.

The real domains were released later in the same track of IPC. These domains were much harder, meaning that most of the official train instances could not be solved by DaE in 15 minutes at all. Therefore the published instance-generator was used, with a different range of generator-parameters. The generator-parameter number\_of\_curbs was running from 6 to 56 with step 5, and generator-parameter the number\_of\_cars from 6 to 31 with step 1. This means a total number of 250 instances. Out of these 230 was solvable and 101 randomly selected were used for train and the remaining 129 for test. However, even generating easier instances would not solve the issue itself: we had to change the default parameters as Population size=1 and Number of offsprings=1. Only this way could we solve so many instances and get some values for number of evaluations. The range of the parameters was also changed: the lower range of Maximum number of stations, Maximum number of nodes, Population size, and Number of offsprings was set to one.

The second figures only considers the first method (from left to right) that discovered the best parameter-set.}
\label{table:hints}
\end{table} 


Table \ref{table:domains} shows the data for each domain: from the 5 domaine, only 3 had enough solvable instances to be used for the learning part. The Mean Square Error (MSE) of the trained ANN is shown for each domain. But because the fitness takes only few values, there can be multiple optimal parameter sets for the same instance, resulting in an unavoidable MSE. 
One iteration of LaO amounts to 5 iterations of CMA-ES, followed by one ANN training and one Genetransferer. Due to the time constraints, only 10 iterations of LaO were run on the Grid, hence CMA-ES was called 50 times in total.

The ANN had 3 fully connected layers, and the hidden layer had the same number of neurons than the input. Standard back-propagation algorithm was used for learning (the default in FANN). In one iteration of LaO, the ANN was only trained for 50 iterations (aka epochs) without reseting the weights, in order to i-avoid over-training, and ii- making a gradual transition from the previous best parameter-set to the new best one, and eventually try some intermediate values. Hence. over the 10 iterations of LaO, 500 iterations (epochs) of the ANN were carried out in total. However, note that the best parameters were trained with much less iterations, depending on the time of their discovery. In the worst case, if the best parameter was found in the last iteration of LaO, it was trained for only 50 epochs and not used anymore. This explains why retraining is needed in the end.

A parameter-set in LaO may come from different sources, namely it can be the default parameter-set, or coming from CMA-ES, the Genetransferer, or as a result of applying the trained ANN to the instance features. Table \ref{table:hints} shows how each source contributes to the best overall parameter-settings. For each possible source, the first number is the ratio the source contributed to the best result if tie-breaks are taken into account, the second number shows the same, if only the first best parameter-set is taken into account. Note that the order of the sources is as it is in the table: for example if CMA-ES found a different parameter-settings with the same fitness than the default, this case that is not included in the first ratio, but is in the second. Analyzing both numbers leads to the following conclusions: for domain Mprime, the default parameter-settings was the optimal for 45\% of the instances. However, only in 2\% of the instances there was no other parameter-setting found with the same quality. In the domain Freecell, the share of ANN is quite high (18\%), moreover we can see that in most cases, the other sources did not find a parameter-set with the same performance (17\%). While Genetransferer in Freecell take equal share (18\%) of all the best parameters, but only a part of them (8\%) were unique. Note that CMA-ES was returning the first hint in each iteration and had 5 times more possibilities than the ANN. Taking this into account, it is clear that both the ANN and Genetransferer made an important contribution to optimization.

LaO has been running for several weeks on a cluster. But this cluster was not dedicated to our experiments, i.e. only a small number of 4 or 8-core processors were available for each domain on average. After stopping LaO, retraining was made with 300 ANN epochs with the best data, because the ANN's saved directly from LaO may be under-trained. The MSE error of the ANN did not decrease using more epochs, which indicates that 300 iterations are enough at least for this amount of data and for this size of the ANN. Tests with 1000 iterations did not produce better results and neither training the ANN uniquely with the first found best parameters.

The controlled parameters of DaE are described in table \ref{table:parameters}. For a detailed description of these parameters, see \cite{BibGECCO:2010}. The feature-set consists of 12 features. The first 5 features are computed from the domain file, after the initial grounding of YAHSP: number of fluents, goals, predicates, objects and types. One further feature we think could even be more important is called mutex-density, which is the number of mutexes divided by the number of all fluent-pairs. We also kept 6 less important features: number of lines, words and byte-count - obtained by the linux command "wc" - of the instance and the domain file. These features were kept only for historical reasons: they were used in the beginning as some "dummy" features.

Since testing was also carried out on the cluster, the termination criterion for testing was also the number of evaluations for each instance. For evaluation the quality-improvement the quality-ratio metric defined in IPC competitions was used. A baseline experiments comes from the default parameter-setting. The ratio of the fitness value for the default parameter and the tuned parameter was computed and average was taken over the instances in the train or test-set. 

\begin{equation}Q=\frac{Fitness_{baseline}}{Fitness_{tuned}}\end{equation}

Table \ref{table:domains} presents several quality-improvement ratios. Label "in LaO" means that the best found parameter is compared to the default. By definition, this ratio can never be less than 1. Quality-improvement ratios for the retrained ANN on both the training-set and the test-set are also presented. In these later cases, numbers less then 1 are possible (the parameters resulting from the retrained ANN can give worse results that the ones given by the original ANN), but were rare. As can be seen on Table \ref{table:domains}, some quality-gain in training was consistently achieved, but the transfer of this improvement to the ANN-model was only partial. The phenomenon can appear because of the unambiguity of the mapping, or because the ANN is complex enough for the mapping, or, and most probably, because the feature-set is not representative enough. On the other hand, the ANN model generalizes excellently to the the independent test-set. Quality-improvement ratios dropped only by 0.01, i.e. the knowledge incorporated in the ANN was transferable to the test cases and usable almost to the same extent than for the train set. The results are quite similar for all domain. Even the size of the training set seems not to be so crucial. For example for Freecell all the instances (108 out of 108 generated) could be used, because they were not so hard. On the other hand, only few  Grid instances (55 out of 107 generated) could be used. However, both performed well. The explanation for this may be that both the 32 and 108 instances covered well the whole range of solvable instances.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{section:conclusions}
\label{section:futurework}	

The LaO method presented in this paper is a surrogate-model based combined learner and optimizer for parameter tuning. LaO was demonstrated to be capable of improving the quality of the DaE algorithm consistently, even though it was run only for a few iterations. On-going work is concerned with running LaO for an appropriate number of iterations. A clearly visible result is also that some of this quality-improvement can be incorporated into an ANN-model, which is also able to generalize excellently to an independent test-set.

The most important experiment to carry out in the future is simply to test the algorithm with more iterations and on more domains -- and this will take several months of CPU even using a large cluster. Since LaO is only a framework, as indicated other kind of learning methods, and other kind of optimization techniques may be incorporated. If an ANN is used, the optimal structure has to be determined, or a more sophisticated solution is to apply one of the so-called Growing Neural Network architectures. Also the benefit of gene-transfer and/or crossover should be investigated further. Gene-transfer shall be improved so that chromosomes are transfered deterministically, measuring the similarity of instances by the similarity of their features. Present results indicate that the current feature set is too small and should be extended for better results.
