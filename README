DESCARWIN is concerned with the hybridization of Descartes (AI planning) and Darwin (Evolutionary Computation) in order to designing satisficing planners.

Here are the steps to build the project:

------------
COMMON STEPS
------------

 * copy the file $ROOT/install-dist.cmake and rename to $ROOT/install.cmake

1) EO:
 * edit the file $ROOT/install.cmake and define the variable EO_DIR
 * ensure to compile yourself openmpi statically and define the variable MPI_DIR
 * ensure to compile yourself boost::mpi statically and define the variables BOOST_*

2) use one of the scripts available to build the project (cf. build_gcc_linux_*)

3) go to the new directory created (cf. release, debug, ...)

4) Location of the generated binaries and libraries:
 * dae binaries are available in the directory dae,
 * cpt-yahsp binaries in cpt-yahsp directory,
 * all the libraries are in lib directory.

 ---------------------------
 AVAILABLE OPTIONS FOR CMAKE
 ---------------------------

You can launch cmake with these options in order to customize your version of dae :
"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" : compilation in debug mode. Without this option, release mode is default.
"-DDAE_WITH_MPI=yes" : compilation with OpenMPI and Boost::MPI to ensure dae parallelization.
"-DCPT_WITH_MP=yes" : compilation of cpt-yahsp with OpenMP (shared memory solution for parallelization).
"-DCPT_WITH_MPI=yes" : comilation of cpt-yahsp with OpenMPI (messsage passage interface for parallelization).
